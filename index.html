        <h1>Vote Eli Sampson for Speaker of the House</h1>
        <h2>Declaration:</h2>
    </div>
    <p>My name is Eli Travis Sampson, and I’m going to be running for Speaker of the House. I am the best candidate for this position for many, many, many reasons, but the biggest is that I bring lots of perspective and a strong, passionate voice to the table. Whether you’re a Democrat, Republican, or somewhere in between, you’ll know with me as Speaker that you’re going to be heard and considered.
Remember: you can’t spell revolution without ELI. So let’s work together to make our country the best that it can possibly be.
Let’s go!
</p>
<br><h3>Eli S. - DEMOCRAT </h3>
<p>Background: <br>
I was born in Wheaton, Illinois on August 17, 2006 and lived there for around three years before moving to a house in West Chicago where I have lived ever since. From the get-go, my parents wanted to instill in me a sense of worldliness and understanding of our town’s unique culture, so they enrolled me in the dual language program at Gary Elementary School. This unique position of being the minority in a primarily hispanic community continued into Middle School and High School and has been extremely formative for my general worldview. I love writing, drawing, and creating in general, and would describe myself as a natural storyteller. Next fall I am attending university, likely close to home, and hopefully for cinema arts. At the moment however, I work at Kindred Coffee Roasters and am a part of our school’s journalism program and AV Club. After High School, I would like to take all of this experience and put it towards telling stories that will hopefully affect people the same way that West Chicago’s stories and unique culture have shaped my life.
</p>
<p>Party Affiliation:<br>
I am a Democrat and would place myself a fair bit left on the spectrum, as the majority of my beliefs are absolutely left-leaning however not extremely strict. As a result of where I’ve grown up, what my parents have taught me, and my own naturally developed beliefs, I would group myself with the liberal side of the political spectrum. This placement comes from my views on abortion, universal healthcare, stricter gun control, freedom of speech, as well as the belief that we should aid immigrants instead of shunning them, while also making sure they are legal.
</p>
<p>Individual Rights and Limited Government:<br>
Though I do believe our god-given freedoms are one of the most important pillars of our country, I do not believe in an entirely limited government. This is because ideally the government would keep these rights protected and ensure that we as people are safe so we can make our own choices regarding free speech, religion, etc. These freedoms should simply be necessary as well as a given, however there is a point (such as with murder and other criminalized acts) where too much freedom would be detrimental, and this is where the government should step in. If your freedom is harming others, for example when refusing to take vaccines, then a limited government would do more harm than good. But when it comes to the pursuit of happiness, whether that involves what you do with your body or speaking out about issues you may feel strongly about (such as racism and prejudice), then the government should remain limited as long as it isn’t unjustifiably hurting the public.
</p>
<p>Common Good and non-Limited Government:<br>
The government should step in and take control when it comes to the safety and well-being of the citizens of our country and use its wide reach to spread good and use its control to bring more possibilities for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This may mean providing more accessible healthcare and insurance for those who may not be able to afford it, as well as granting more student loan forgiveness for those drowning in debt from college. Besides granting accessibility to better means for living, I believe that the government should also step in with force with things like gun control (which could involve giving up the right to bear arms if not certified), as well as for other issues that involve the greater good overall. For example; requiring certain vaccinations, requiring some sort of schooling for the youth, etc.
</p>
<p>Federalism:<br>
I believe that as long as there is still a fair distribution of power and representatives from each state, that the majority of power should remain with the federal government. Especially with larger issues such as climate change, vaccine use, gun control, and abortion, leaving the decisions of how to tackle these topics up to the federal government would be advantageous for having a united front and keeping states from quarrelling over issues which are mostly impacting the country in the same manner all over. However, it should ideally be a mix of power between the federal and state governments, with the federal government having the overall say with larger problems and the state governments dealing with ones that are more in their space and not affecting the entire country. The states should focus more on the education system, economy, and other areas that may be more uniquely suited toward their geography and culture. This leaves the federal government to drive us towards a greater and more collaborative future, while the states can focus on making the present as livable as possible for the people who live in them. 
</p>
<p>Personal Stance On Issues:<br>
As a Democrat, most of the issues I feel strongest about revolve around the three core values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that our country is built on. Growing up in the community that I have, topics like immigration are very important to me as they greatly affect people that I’m close with and interact with in my everyday life. Alongside that, I believe that abortion should be an option for all and that women (and others) should be able to choose what they do with their own bodies as well as with their love lives as long as it's not hurting or bothering anybody. Another important topic to me is also the possible implementation of a progressive tax system, which would make life easier and more affordable for those at the bottom and in the middle and further tax the rich in order to use that money to improve our country and pay off debt. Universal healthcare also goes with that, as everyone in our country should be able to have an equal opportunity at living life to the fullest, and our government especially should make that a top priority when we have the resources to do so. Finally, preventing censorship should also be of the utmost importance. For example, in relation to the topic of flag burnings for protest, we should still have that option no matter how archaic it may be. It’s more important that we keep the option of speaking our mind in the ways we desire (unless it involves harming others) instead of censoring something just because it may offend.
